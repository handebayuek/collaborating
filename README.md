## The recipe for your favorite dish:

Here's a basic recipe for making traditional Japanese ramen at home. Keep in mind that there are many variations, and you can customize it based on your preferences 🍜

For the broth:

4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
1 onion, sliced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1-inch piece of ginger, grated
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon mirin (sweet rice wine)
1 tablespoon sake (Japanese rice wine)
1 teaspoon sesame oil
Salt and pepper to taste

For the noodles:

Ramen noodles (fresh or instant)
For toppings (choose your favorites):
Sliced green onions
Bamboo shoots
Nori (seaweed sheets)
Soft-boiled eggs
Sliced mushrooms
Spinach
Sliced pork or chicken (optional)

Instructions:

In a large pot, heat sesame oil over medium heat. Add sliced onions, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Sauté until the onions are translucent.
Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring it to a simmer. Add soy sauce, mirin, and sake. Allow the broth to simmer for at least 15-20 minutes to let the flavors meld. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
While the broth is simmering, prepare your ramen noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
Prepare your chosen toppings. You can sauté or blanch vegetables, slice the green onions, and have the soft-boiled eggs ready.
Once the broth is ready, strain it to remove the onion, garlic, and ginger pieces, leaving a clear broth.
Assemble your ramen bowls by placing a portion of cooked noodles in each bowl. Pour the hot broth over the noodles.
Add your chosen toppings to each bowl.
Serve the ramen hot and enjoy!
Feel free to experiment with the ingredients and adjust the seasoning according to your taste. Ramen is a versatile dish, and you can get creative with different proteins, vegetables, and flavorings.`

## The definition of a word:

Outer space 🌌 (or simply space) is the expanse beyond celestial bodies and their atmospheres. Outer space is not completely empty; it is a near-perfect vacuum[1] containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (−270 °C; −455 °F).[2]
